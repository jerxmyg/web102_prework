## Notes

I was stuck on step 3 of challenge 2 for a some time becuase of a syn tax error that didn't allow me to put in the right key until I realized that I needed to exculde the punctuation mark so that was fun. On a serious note, it has defintely been a fun journey for me and I look forward to this course this semester!
